# Salesforce Omnichannel Inventory POSTMAN Collection

This repository contains sample POSTMAN collections that you can leverage to understand how the Salesforce Omni Channel Inventory endpoints are working using both the Commerce API and the Core Platform API, and can be used to operate with your Salesforce Omni Channel Inventory instance.

Please look at either the `Commerce APIs` or `Core Platform APIs` folders to start using one or the other collection.
